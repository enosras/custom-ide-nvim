WELCOME TO MY NVIM/IDE CONFIGURATION

HISTORY
When I was a boy, grwoing up in an East African city, meeting the cyberworld from the dust, the programming bug bit me. But there was a problem. I had no access to computers. And then came the question of programming environment, the applications that make editing of source code possible. I thought these magical tools incredible. And I inadvertently stumbled on the NVIM community, and the tooling community in general. 

Apart from that, I have also followed the Zsh community, expanding into the oh-my-zsh emulator movement. 

But, the community must forgive me, for entering the game late, and all I do is currently study source code, and all of which have also led to a keen interest in the Lua language. To be honest, I find most programming language to be well within my understanding, and that  is why I kinda focus on tooling.
